    "Markov decision processes are the formal description of decision making processes. THey are defined by a set of states, possible actions for states, and rewards. Non-Markovian dynamics are cases when actions taken impact the environment it interacts with. This means the value of future states and actions are contingent upon previous actions event even when the agent is occupying the same state with the same set of actions. "
